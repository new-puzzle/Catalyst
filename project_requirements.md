Project: Catalyst - The AI Action OSTech Stack:Frontend: React (Vite), TailwindCSS, Framer Motion.Backend: Python (FastAPI).Database: SQLite (Metadata/Chat History), ChromaDB (Vector Memory).Auth & Integrations: Google OAuth 2.0 (Drive), Hume AI (Empathic Voice).1. Core PhilosophyA Voice-First, privacy-focused productivity companion. While it fully supports text chat, the primary interaction model is spoken conversation—using Empathic AI (Hume) to understand tone and nuance. It bridges the gap between "Rambling Thoughts" and "Concrete Actions."2. The "Smart Input" Interface (Frontend)Authentication:Landing page with "Sign in with Google."Stores OAuth Refresh Token locally (encrypted).The Mode Selectors:✨ Auto (Default)🏗️ Architect (Blue)🎭 Simulator (Purple - Powered by Hume)✍️ Scribe (Green)Input Actions (Voice-First Hierarchy):Primary Action (The Orb): A large, central "Call Catalyst" button. Tapping this launches the full-screen Hume Voice Interface for hands-free discussion.Secondary Action (The Bar): A standard text input bar at the bottom with a small "Mic" icon (WebSpeech API) for quick dictation or silent typing.Unified File Upload:Drag-and-drop or "Select from Drive" to add context to the conversation.3. The "Neural Vault" (Backend Memory)Storage Hierarchy:./data/db/conversations.db: Chat history../data/db/vector_store/: ChromaDB embeddings../data/files/local/ & ./data/files/drive_sync/: Documents.The Ingestion Engine (RAG):Drive Sync Job: Background task to sync and embed Google Drive files.Emotion Logger: When using Hume, log the "Top 3 Emotions" (e.g., Anxiety: 0.8) alongside the text transcript to track the user's mental state over time.4. Feature SpecsThe "Connect the Dots" Button: Queries Vector DB (across Ramblings, Drive files, and Emotional History) to generate a "Synthesis Report."Simulator Mode (Hume Integrated):Real-time Latency: Uses Hume's WebSocket API for <500ms interruptions.Emotional Feedback: After a simulation, the app reports: "You said the right words, but your tone indicated 70% Hesitation. Try sounding more authoritative."Scribe Mode:Can reference Drive files and historical tone.Export: "Save to Drive" button.5. Privacy & Security Constraints (CRITICAL)Hybrid Audio:Hume: Audio streams to Hume servers (User must consent for Simulator/Deep Chat).Local: Standard dictation uses browser-native WebSpeech (Private).Drive Scope: drive.readonly by default.API Hygiene: Only send relevant chunks to LLM.6. Implementation Steps for ClaudeSetup: Initialize React + FastAPI structure.Hume Integration: Install hume SDK. Create a voice_handler.py to manage the WebSocket connection and prosody analysis.Auth & Drive: Implement Google OAuth and Drive Connector.RAG Pipeline: Update ingestion for Drive files.Frontend: Add Google Sign-In, Drive Picker, and the Hume "Orb" visualizer for voice chat.
